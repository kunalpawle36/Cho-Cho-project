This dataset was provided already clean and ready for analysis, with consistent schemas and no missing key values.
Files include dimension tables and a fact table organized for star-schema reporting in Power BI.
I have created DAX measures including YoY%, Total Gross Sales, Total Revenue, and Total Profit for common analyses.
Measures are designed to be sliced by date, product, geography, and channel for performant visuals.
